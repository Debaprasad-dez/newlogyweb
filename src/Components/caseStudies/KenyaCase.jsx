                  Kenya, a nation with a population of more than 50 million,
                  suffers from a severe lack of dental care services. The
                  shortage of dental professionals, particularly in rural and
                  underserved areas, presents a significant obstacle. Colgate
                  and Logy.AI partnered together to develop an oral screening
                  tool in Kenya to address the country's shortage of dental care
                  facilities.{" "}

                  The cornerstone of the chatbot is the free dental screenings
                  and oral care tips available to its users. The tool is a
                  wonderful resource that is supported by WhatsApp, allowing
                  Colgate to connect with the masses of the country. The
                  application is straightforward to use, educational, and
                  readily accessible to all users. Users who have access to a
                  smartphone with internet access and WhatsApp installed can
                  carry out screenings within minutes. The high number of
                  screenings performed, and the general improvement in oral
                  hygiene practices among the general public are all indicators
                  of the success of the tool in providing free screenings and
